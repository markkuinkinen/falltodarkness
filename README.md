My first game; "Fall to Darkness"

Uploaded here are the scripts that I've used for my first game "Fall to Darkness"

Unfortunately I wasn't aware of webgl at the time of building the game, and I no longer have the source files to build it. However, the playable game can be downloaded from my Google Drive here (117mb),
